A collection of printed circuit boards used to make Open Saber designs.

`pcb` files are printed by ExpressPCB.

## emitter

The "emitter" files are the front of the lightsaber, and mount the MOSFETs,
capacitor, and some switch electronics. 

v1 is deprecated. v2 is in use. v3 is the potential next version.

There are a few board variations in the 
files themselves:

- RGB emitter, with holes to connect to the main microcontroller.
- RGBW emitter, with holes to connect to the main microcontroller. This
  version is untested.
- RGB emitter, with a mount for 0.1" pin header. The Gecko switch plate
  mounts directly to the circuit board.
