A collection of printed circuit boards used to make Open Saber designs.

`pcb` files are printed by ExpressPCB.

## emitter

The "emitter" files are the front of the lightsaber, and mount the MOSFETs,
capacitor, and some switch electronics. 

There are 2 main variations:
- The prop shield variation (on top) for a Teensy 3.2 and Prop Shield.
- The component model (on bottom) for a Teensy 3.2 and additional discrete 
  components: accelerometer, amplifier, etc.
